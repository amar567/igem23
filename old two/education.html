          <div class="p_content text-2xl py-5">
            Education is not confined within four walls; it must be disseminated. Communication is an integral part of science and its branches. Engaging with people, spreading awareness, and sharing knowledge epitomize the essence of science. Effective science communication can help bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and the general public, making complex scientific concepts accessible. Keeping these in mind, this year we, the iGEM team of iiser Kolkata, have followed various ways and methods and conducted different outreaches in order to spread science communication among more people. People of different kinds and age groups (from children to old) were targeted by us. In India, approximately 22% of the population is still illiterate, and many children do not have access to quality education, especially in rural and economically disadvantaged areas. We tried to spread education, especially science education, among them too. We organized a lot of science camps in different places, workshops, webinars, competitions, meet-ups; made comic strip, story book for children, instrumentation videos, science posts in social media; took part in some poster presentations; these all were not only project specific, but were also connected to science education. We tried to reach the general public through newspapers, magazines and social media. We tried our best to teach and motivate people towards science and during all these events we learnt a lot from them too.These moments of scientific exploration, knowledge-sharing, and engaging discussions were incredibly valuable to us. We tried to make people aware (students, teachers and general public) about the problem of bacterial blight in rice-agriculture fields.
  
            Through extensive interviews conducted with various stakeholders (farmers, pesticide dealers, agriculture officers, farmer associations, professors and scientists, biocontrol companies, and industries), in different locations, a prevailing issue became evident—the substantial lack of education among farmers. As farmers are the primary stakeholders of agriculture, our team implemented a range of educational initiatives (enactment of street plays, poster presentations, surveys, and the distribution of pamphlets) targeting them. We hope, empowering farmers with knowledge and resources, awareness campaigns can help mitigate the spread of bacterial blight in India and specifically in states like West Bengal, ultimately contributing to improved agricultural productivity and livelihoods.
            
            In a nutshell, we made brave and compelling attempts to implement science communication among all, to allow mutual learning, together for a better tomorrow.
