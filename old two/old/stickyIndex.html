            Rice: Nourishing the world, one grain at a time
          </p>
          <p>
            Rice (Oryza sativa L.), which provides 20% of all calories ingested,
            is the primary diet for nearly half of the world's population. In
            2000, there were 600 million tonnes of rice produced worldwide; by
            2030, with a 1.5-fold growth, there may be 904 million tonnes
            produced. Asia is the region where most of the world's rice is
            produced and farmed. The goal of increasing production while
            reducing losses seems extremely compelling given the projected 34%
            rise in global population to 9.3 billion people by 2050, as well as
            the known threat of increased pathogen and pest introductions due to
            various factors like increased human mobility, global trade, and
            climate change. Therefore, it is essential that any future crop
            management measures properly consider the danger posed by both
            existing and emerging crop diseases and pests.

            <p>
              The bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae is the source of the destructive
              disease known as bacterial blight, which affects millions of
              hectares worldwide. In Southeast Asian countries, yield losses are
              expected to range from 10%–20% in middling conditions to up to 50%
              in favorable conditions. The earlier the disease manifests itself,
              the greater the yield loss.<br /><br />

                      Xanthomonas : Cause of Bacterial Blight

                    <p>
                      The bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae is the source of the destructive
                      disease known as bacterial blight, which affects millions of
                      hectares worldwide. In Southeast Asian countries, yield losses are
                      expected to range from 10%–20% in middling conditions to up to 50%
                      in favorable conditions. The earlier the disease manifests itself,
                      the greater the yield loss.<br /><br />
