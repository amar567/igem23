BBa_K4781000,http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4781000:Design,Composite,Team iGEM IISER-Kolkata ‘ 23 designed a DSF - Diffusible signal factor sensing module that get’s activated upon sensing DSF -Diffusible signal factor . DSF is the quorum sensing molecule of Xanthomonas species  -  which it uses for cell-cell communication.We hacked the system of the Xanthomonas and synthetically engineered the Ecoli to be able to detect the DSF -  and hence providing a signal of its presence. rpfC encodes a hybrid two-component regulator -  containing both sensor kinase and response regulator domains.RpfG belongs to a large -  recently described superfamily of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases containing an HD domain. Activated RpfG degrades cyclic di-GMP to GMP -  leading to the activation of Clp -  a global transcriptional regulator that regulates a large set of genes in the DSF pathway.,3433bp
BBa_K4781001,http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4781001:Design,Composite,Riboswitches are typically RNA elements located in the 5′ untranslated region of mRNAs. They are highly structured and specifically recognize and respond to a given chemical cue to alter transcription termination or translation initiation. Riboswitch-mediated gene regulation in Vibrio cholerae involves a 3′ riboswitch -  named Vc2 -  that controls the stability of upstream untranslated RNA upon binding to its cognate ligand -  the second messenger cyclic di-GMP -  leading to the accumulation of previously undescribed putative sRNAs.This composite part would give an indication of the cGMP levels in the prokaryotic cell. Low cGMP levels lead to linearization of the VC2 riboswitch -  ultimately leading to downstream gene transcription -  which consists of the reporter gene gfas purple. When bound to cGMP -  VC2 riboswitch acts as an off switch.,1072bp
BBa_K4781002,http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4781002,Basic,The twin arginine translocase (Tat) is a protein transport pathway that exists in archaea -  bacteria -  and plant chloroplasts. In bacteria -  it exports proteins across the plasma membrane and is important for many processes -  including energy metabolism -  formation of the cell envelope -  biofilm formation -  heavy metal resistance -  nitrogen-fixing symbiosis -  bacterial pathogenesis and others . What makes this protein transport system unusual compared to other transport systems (such as the general secretory -  or Sec pathway) is its ability to transport fully folded proteins across membranes. This remarkable feat has no requirement for ATP as an energy source and relies solely on the proton motive force (PMF).,270bp
BBa_K4781003,http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4781003,Basic,In Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria -  TatA -  TatB -  and TatC are all essential for efficient translocation. The twin arginine translocase (Tat) is a protein transport pathway that exists in archaea -  bacteria -  and plant chloroplasts. In bacteria -  it exports proteins across the plasma membrane and is important for many processes -  including energy metabolism -  formation of the cell envelope -  biofilm formation -  heavy metal resistance -  nitrogen-fixing symbiosis -  bacterial pathogenesis and others .

BBa_K4781004,http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4781004,Basic,TatC is the largest and most highly conserved Tat component. The E. coli TatC is a 258-amino-acid polytopic membrane protein with six TM helices and both the N and C termini located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane,777bp
BBa_K4781005,http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4781005,Basic,Tat protein TatE that is homologous to the TatA protein is present at a much lower level in the cell than TatA. n Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria -  TatA -  TatB -  and TatC and TatE are all essential for efficient translocation. The twin arginine translocase (Tat) is a protein transport pathway that exists in archaea -  bacteria -  and plant chloroplasts. In bacteria -  it exports proteins across the plasma membrane and is important for many processes -  including energy metabolism -  formation of the cell envelope -  biofilm formation -  heavy metal resistance -  nitrogen-fixing symbiosis -  bacterial pathogenesis and others,204bp
BBa_K4781006,http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4781006,Basic,SpTorA is a signal peptide for the periplasmic translocation of the folded protein. N terminal SpTorA targets protein to localize into periplasm through Tat machinery. This Signal peptide has a short 'AQAAR' linker to tag the target protein.,135 bp
BBa_K4781007,http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4781007:Design,Basic,FnCas12a with proper guide RNA can be used to insert specific genes. Also due to its own guide RNA maturation ability -  it is used for multiplex gene editing. C terminal 6XHis tag help to purify protein by Ni-NTA chromatography and also can be used to detect protein by using an anti-His antibody.,3921bp
BBa_K4781009,http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4781009,Basic,crRNA-fliC-direct repeat will produce guide RNA against the flagellin protein Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae with a direct repeat at the end which can be used to make crRNA array . This 19 nucleotides direct repeat is an essential part of the guide RNA of FnCas12a. To design guide RNA -  20nt complementary sequence of the target gene just has to be added after the direct repeat.,58 bp
