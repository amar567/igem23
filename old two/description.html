                            In India, agriculture is of utmost importance for several compelling reasons. Economically,
                            it stands as a formidable pillar, engaging over half of India's workforce and contributing a
                            substantial 20% to the nation's GDP, showcasing its pivotal role in powering its economic
                            engine. This year, our team wanted to focus on the importance of Rice Agriculture in India.
                            Rice (Oryza sativa L.), which provides 20% of all calories ingested, is the primary diet for
                            nearly half of the world's population. In 2000, there were 600 million tonnes of rice
                            produced worldwide; by 2030, with a 1.5-fold growth, there may be 904 million tonnes
                            produced (1).

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Asia is the region where most of the world's rice is produced and farmed. The goal of
                            increasing production while reducing losses seems extremely compelling given the projected
                            34% rise in global population to 9.3 billion people by 2050 (2), as well as the known threat
                            of increased pathogen and pest introductions due to various factors like increased human
                            mobility, global trade, and climate change. Therefore, it is essential that any future crop
                            management measures properly consider the danger posed by both existing and emerging crop
                            diseases and pests.

                        <p class="p_content mt-5 text-2xl">In the realm of agriculture, synthetic biology offers
                            exciting possibilities, especially when focusing on vital crops like rice. In our
                            brainstorming phase, we had the privilege of attending a talk by Dr. Kutubuddin A Molla, an
                            expert in genome engineering using CRISPR-Cas systems for rice plants. His talk sparked our
                            interest in exploring CRISPR technology and its application to tackle various diseases
                            affecting rice plants. Given our proximity to rice farming communities, we took the
                            initiative to engage with local rice farmers and understand the challenges they face. We
                            discovered alarming issues like pesticide misuse and the adverse effects of chemical
                            pesticides on rice crops. Many of our team members have family members involved in farming,
                            which deepened our understanding of the problems at hand. Through these conversations, we
                            identified a concerning issue - bacterial blight, caused by the Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae
                            bacteria, posing a significant threat to rice cultivation.</p>

                        <h1 class="h1_content text-3xl font-semibold">The Problem - <em>Xanthomonas Oryzae</em></h1>
                        <p class="p_content mt-5 text-2xl">Infections caused by Xanthomonas species, particularly
                            Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae, pose a significant problem in agriculture, specifically in
                            rice farming. This bacterium is responsible for bacterial blight, a devastating disease
                            affecting rice plants. Bacterial blight manifests as water-soaked lesions on leaves,
                            eventually leading to wilting, browning, and death of the plant's tissue. The disease
                            disrupts photosynthesis and nutrient transportation, severely impacting crop yield and
                            quality. In Southeast Asian countries, yield losses are expected to range from 10%â€“20% in
                            middling conditions to up to 50% in favorable conditions. The earlier the disease manifests
                            itself, the greater the yield loss.</p>

                        <p class="p_content mt-5 text-2xl">There are about 27 different plant species that are affected
                            by Xanthomonas infections. These
                            species display high levels of genetic diversity, damaging up to 400 different plant species
                            (3). Hence, during our design, we had in mind to design our bio-control agent not just
                            limited to Xanthomonas oryzae, but also to target it against other virulence factors across
                            the conserved species.
                            One of the well-known interesting facts is the bacteriophytochrome-mediated mechanism used
                            by the <i>Xanthomonas</i> infection method. It is hypothesised that day-night variations
                            play a crucial role in <i>Xanthomonas</i> infections. If these changes are altered due to
                            climate change there can be a significant rise in the infections taking place.(13)

                            We wanted to help our farmers in Agricultural field by doing something that would reduce
                            bacterial blight infections and in turn reduce losses they suffer due to it.
                            This motivated us to create our novel solution:
