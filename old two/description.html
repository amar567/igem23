                        In India, agriculture is of utmost importance for several compelling reasons. Economically,
                        it stands as a formidable pillar, engaging over half of India's workforce and contributing a
                        substantial 20% to the nation's GDP, showcasing its pivotal role in powering its economic
                        engine. This year, our team wanted to focus on the importance of Rice Agriculture in India.
                        Rice (Oryza sativa L.), which provides 20% of all calories ingested, is the primary diet for
                        nearly half of the world's population. In 2000, there were 600 million tonnes of rice
                        produced worldwide; by 2030, with a 1.5-fold growth, there may be 904 million tonnes
                        produced (1).

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Asia is the region where most of the world's rice is produced and farmed. The goal of
                        increasing production while reducing losses seems extremely compelling given the projected
                        34% rise in global population to 9.3 billion people by 2050 (2), as well as the known threat
                        of increased pathogen and pest introductions due to various factors like increased human
                        mobility, global trade, and climate change. Therefore, it is essential that any future crop
                        management measures properly consider the danger posed by both existing and emerging crop
                        diseases and pests.

                    <p class="p_content mt-5 text-2xl">In the realm of agriculture, synthetic biology offers
                        exciting possibilities, especially when focusing on vital crops like rice. In our
                        brainstorming phase, we had the privilege of attending a talk by Dr. Kutubuddin A Molla, an
                        expert in genome engineering using CRISPR-Cas systems for rice plants. His talk sparked our
                        interest in exploring CRISPR technology and its application to tackle various diseases
                        affecting rice plants. Given our proximity to rice farming communities, we took the
                        initiative to engage with local rice farmers and understand the challenges they face. We
                        discovered alarming issues like pesticide misuse and the adverse effects of chemical
                        pesticides on rice crops. Many of our team members have family members involved in farming,
                        which deepened our understanding of the problems at hand. Through these conversations, we
                        identified a concerning issue - bacterial blight, caused by the Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae
                        bacteria, posing a significant threat to rice cultivation.</p>

                    <p class="p_content mt-5 text-2xl">Infections caused by Xanthomonas species, particularly
                        Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae, pose a significant problem in agriculture, specifically in
                        rice farming. This bacterium is responsible for bacterial blight, a devastating disease
                        affecting rice plants. Bacterial blight manifests as water-soaked lesions on leaves,
                        eventually leading to wilting, browning, and death of the plant's tissue. The disease
                        disrupts photosynthesis and nutrient transportation, severely impacting crop yield and
                        quality. In Southeast Asian countries, yield losses are expected to range from 10%–20% in
                        middling conditions to up to 50% in favorable conditions. The earlier the disease manifests
                        itself, the greater the yield loss.</p>

                    <p class="p_content mt-5 text-2xl">There are about 27 different plant species that are affected
                        by Xanthomonas infections. These
                        species display high levels of genetic diversity, damaging up to 400 different plant species
                        (3). Hence, during our design, we had in mind to design our bio-control agent not just
                        limited to Xanthomonas oryzae, but also to target it against other virulence factors across
                        the conserved species.
                        One of the well-known interesting facts is the bacteriophytochrome-mediated mechanism used
                        by the <i>Xanthomonas</i> infection method. It is hypothesised that day-night variations
                        play a crucial role in <i>Xanthomonas</i> infections. If these changes are altered due to
                        climate change there can be a significant rise in the infections taking place.(13)

                        We wanted to help our farmers in Agricultural field by doing something that would reduce
                        bacterial blight infections and in turn reduce losses they suffer due to it.
                        This motivated us to create our novel solution:

                    <p class="p_content text-2xl w-[80%] mt-5">Our chassis, Escherichia coli USML2, is a rice
                        plant growth-promoting endophyte. It grows in the inner leaf surfaces and the interior of
                        the plant tissues and thus shares the same niche as Xoo (pathogen)
                        Upon sensing the presence of Xoo, our 'chassis' releases OMVs that carry CRISPR
                        Fncas12a/crRNA ribonucleoprotein complex. These packages work like tiny missiles to target
                        and eliminate the harmful Xanthomonas pathogen.

                    <p class="p_content text-2xl w-[80%] mt-5">We have shown application of our project for one such
                        model phytopathogen, i.e. Xoo. However our project can be expanded to be used against many
                        more phytopathogens. Not only this, our project sets a primer to use Bacterial OMVs as
                        delivery vehicles. However they can be used for many more applications like:
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-2xl w-[80%] mt-5">OMVs have diverse biomedical applications, including vaccines,
                        adjuvants, cancer
                        immunotherapy, drug delivery, anti-bacterial adhesion agents, and antibacterial therapy.<br>
                        OMVs can serve as effective vaccines against pathogenic bacteria, inducing both cellular and
                        humoral immune responses.<br>
                        As adjuvants, OMVs enhance immune responses when mixed with antigens in vaccine
                        preparations.<br>
                        In cancer immunotherapy, OMVs can induce immune responses against tumor tissues or serve as
                        nanocarriers for loading chemotherapeutic agents. [12]
